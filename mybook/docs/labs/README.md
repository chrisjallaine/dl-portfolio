## Laboratory ðŸ’»

Welcome to the **Labs** section of my Deep Learning Portfolio.  
This folder contains my lab exercises where I explore concepts, algorithms, and practical applications in **Deep Learning** and **Data Science**.

How to Use This Folder:

Each lab is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook**. To navigate:  

1. Click on a lab file in the table of contents or folder navigation.  
2. Follow the notebook sequentially, as the exercises build on each other.  
3. You can run the code cells to reproduce experiments or analyze the results.

Labs Folder Overview:

- **Lab 1:** 
- **Lab 2:** Perform a single forward pass in a feedforward neural network by computing weighted sums, applying activation functions, and generating an output.
- **Lab 3:** Learned how to implement both **forward and backward propagation** in a feedforward neural network.  
- **Lab 4:** Training a linear regression model in PyTorch involves defining a simple network, selecting a suitable loss function (MSE), and using an optimizer (SGD) to update weights.   
- **Lab 5:** Learned how PyTorch tensor objects work, including creating them from scratch, converting NumPy arrays, and performing key operations like indexing, slicing, reshaping, and arithmetic.

Key Takeaways:

- Hands-on re-practice with **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.  
- Building and training **Deep Learning models** with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
- Understanding of **data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization techniques**.  

Explore my notebooks to see how these concepts are applied in each lab exercise.  
Happy learning with me! ðŸŽ‰
