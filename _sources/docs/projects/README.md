# Projects üóÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Projects** section of my Deep Learning Portfolio.  
This folder contains my **major projects** where I apply concepts from labs to real-world or simulated problems.

How to Use This Folder:

Each project is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook** or a set of notebooks. To navigate:

1. Click on a project file in the table of contents or folder navigation.  
2. Read the **project description** at the top of each notebook to understand the goal and approach.  
3. Run the code cells to reproduce results or explore modifications.  

Projects Overview:
<div style="border: 2px solid #4CAF50; background-color: #e8f5e9; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
